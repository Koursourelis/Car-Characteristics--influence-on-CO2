# Exploring the Relationship Between Car Characteristics and Environmental Factors  
### Statistical Analysis in R

This project explores car data using **R**, applying statistical analysis, data visualization, and regression modeling to examine relationships between key variables such as **fuel consumption**, **engine characteristics**, and **CO₂ emissions**.

## 📊 What’s Inside

- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Regression modeling
- Data visualizations
- Insightful interpretation of trends and relationships

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset was scraped from [Autotriti.com](https://www.autotriti.com/) and includes various technical and environmental specifications of car models.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **R** for data analysis and visualization
- **ggplot2** for plotting
- **dplyr** and **tidyr** for data wrangling
- **readr** for CSV input

## 📈 Key Objectives

- Understand the correlation between fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions
- Explore how engine features relate to environmental performance
- Apply regression techniques to model variable relationships

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `.R` script in RStudio
2. Install required packages (if not already installed):
   ```R
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr"))
